--Theory:

//Aggregate Functions: COUNT, AVG, SUM, MAX, MIN

//Grouping data: GROUP BY, HAVING, GROUPING SETS


--Practical tasks:

Create products_inventory table with PK which is autoincremented 
and the following structure (all fields are mandatory):

//Product name

//Available quantity

//Product type алкохол/хранителни/напитки

//Price without VAT

//Price with VAT

//Is product in stock

//Warehouse (can be an id, name of city, etc - it doesnt matter)


--Create scripts using aggregation functions and functions for grouping data:

//Get the count of all available products in stock

//--Get the count of all not available products in stock, grouped by product name

//Get the average product price with VAT for all categories

//Get the total amount of all available items in stock (use price with VAT and available qty.)

//Find the most and least expensive item from the table

//Find the most expensive item in each warehouse

//Get the count of all products for each category

//Get the count of all products for each category in and out of stock

//Get the count of all products for each category where the products count is more than 3

//Get the inventory amount for each warehouse

//Get all product categories stored by each warehouse
--Example:
--Sofia_wh -> food
--Sofia_wh -> drink
--Plovdiv_wh -> wine
--Plovdiv_wh -> fruits
...


//Get the avarage product categories hold by the warehouses 
--Example: 
--Sofia_wh -> 2 product categories
--Plovdiv_wh -> 6 product categories
--AVG: 2+6 products / 2 warehouses
 
--Acceptance criteria:

//As a QA Automation trainee, I want to gain knowledge of how to 
use aggregate functions and count data.
